# FileTransferProgram
This project is a secure file transfer application that uses AES and DES for encryption and RSA for digital signatures. It ensures data integrity and authenticity during transmission. The user-friendly GUI allows users to select files, choose encryption methods, and manage server connections, all while logging key actions for reference.
